KE-Bot
An Advanced Robotic Scanning System


The KE-Bot (U.S Patented), the newest FUE innovation by Dr. Koray Erdogan, is an advanced robotic 360-degree circular scanning system that evaluates all aspects of hair transplantation through high definition photography that provides 3-D scalp modeling and data collection from every angle. This includes the pre-surgical determination of each hair’s caliber and density in the donor area, and overall donor capacity thereby assisting the surgeon to obtain extremely accurate extraction site calculations with potential transection rates. Additionally, the KE-Bot calculates Coverage Value (an important calculation also developed by Dr. Erdogan) affecting both the donor and recipient areas to insure adequate homogenization and density without overharvesting while taking into consideration normal hair loss with aging.

Moreover, KE-Bot is able to determine the number of grafts placed in previous surgeries by counting previous extraction sites. Post-surgically, it scans the recipient area and determines the actual number of grafts placed and the density obtained while reporting authentic transection rates in relation to the number of placed grafts. Although the KE- Bot is presently in limited production, it promises to be adopted by surgeons worldwide due to its extrem and youtube link ; "https://youtu.be/h4fb9t-MLog"
