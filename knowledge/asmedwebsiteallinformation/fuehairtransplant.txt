Hair Transplant
What is a FUE Hair Transplant?
A Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE) hair transplant is a surgical procedure that involves individually extracting hair follicles from a donor area, typically the back of the head, and implanting them into areas experiencing hair loss. This minimally invasive technique is known for its precision and ability to produce natural-looking results without leaving a linear scar.

Follicular unit extraction (FUE)
FUE is a method of graft harvest that is used in FUE hair transplants. It is the latest major technical advancement in hair restoration surgery.

In an FUE hair transplant, a large number of hair follicles is obtained in a single day providing excellent regrowth and patient tolerance without any great scarring.

Each individual follicular unit (FU) is obtained directly from the scalp, rather than from a strip of donor tissue that has been removed from the scalp.

FUE hair transplants were originally performed using manually hand-held punches of various types and are still used to remove follicular units one at a time.

In general, any patient who is a candidate for hair restoration surgery is a candidate for FUE hair transplant. A patient may be a poor candidate for a strip harvest, yet may achieve a good result with FUE.

How is FUE Hair Transplant Applied?
Consultation: Discuss goals with the surgeon.
Preparation: Clean and numb areas with local anesthesia.
Extraction: Use a small punch tool to extract hair follicles.
Graft Preparation: Inspect and sort follicles.
Recipient Site Creation: Make incisions in balding areas.
Implantation: Insert follicles into recipient sites.
Post-Procedure Care: Follow aftercare instructions.
The Benefits of FUE Hair Transplant
Minimally Invasive: No stitches or linear scars.
Quick Recovery: Faster healing time compared to traditional methods.
Natural Results: Hair grows in a natural pattern.
Less Discomfort: Minimal pain during and after the procedure.
Versatility: Suitable for various hair types and scalp conditions.
What are FUE Hair Transplant Techniques?
There are several techniques used in FUE hair transplants:

Manual FUE: Surgeon manually extracts and implants hair follicles using a handheld device.
Motorized FUE: Uses a motorized device to assist in the extraction of follicles.
Robotic FUE: Utilizes robotic technology to precisely extract and implant hair follicles.
Is There Any Side Effect of FUE Hair Transplant?
While FUE hair transplants are generally safe, some potential side effects include temporary swelling in the donor and recipient areas, infection (though rare, it is possible if aftercare instructions are not followed), minor bleeding during and after the procedure, and small, dot-like scars that are usually not noticeable.

Who is a Good Candidate For FUE Hair Transplant?
Good candidates for FUE hair transplants typically include individuals with pattern baldness, both men and women experiencing genetic hair loss. Candidates should have adequate donor hair, meaning there is sufficient hair in the donor area for extraction. They should also be healthy individuals without medical conditions that could complicate the surgery. Additionally, ideal candidates should have realistic expectations, understanding the limitations and potential results of the procedure.

Fue Hair Transplant Results
FUE hair transplants can produce natural-looking, long-lasting results. Full hair transplant results are typically visible within 12 to 18 months as the transplanted hair goes through a growth cycle. Patients can expect increased hair density and a more youthful appearance.

An FUE hair transplant provides;

shaving the head without any noticeable scarring (to wear hair <2 mm.)
no sutures, no permanent linear scar
decreased healing time, comfortable healing process
less post-operative pain
fewer limits on post-op activity
viable alternative in people with very tight scalps
extends the donor area
useful if limited number of grafts are needed
ideal to repair donor scar
operation in low-density donor hair,
debulking plugs and minigrafts
removal of undesirable hairline grafts
body hair harvest
no permanently distortion of hair growth angles
FUE requires a steep learning curve, patience, physical stamina and endurance, a delicate touch, excellent hand–eye coordination and excellent hand motor skills.

An FUE hair transplant can be done well or badly just as any other form of surgery.

FUE Hair Transplant Reviews
John D.

"I was initially nervous about the procedure, but my surgeon was incredibly skilled and put me at ease. The results are amazing, and I couldn't be happier with my new hairline.”

Lisa M.

"The FUE hair transplant exceeded my expectations. The process was smooth, and I experienced very little pain. I started noticing new hair growth within a few months, and now, a year later, my hair looks completely natural."

FUE Hair Transplant Cost
The cost of an FUE hair transplant varies based on several factors:

Location: Prices vary by country and city.
Clinic Reputation: Renowned clinics may charge more.
Surgeon Expertise: Experienced surgeons may have higher fees.
Number of Grafts: More grafts increase the overall cost.
Additional Services: Post-operative care and medications can add to the cost.
Generally, FUE hair transplant cost can range from $4,000 to $15,000 or more. It is important to consult with a reputable clinic to get an accurate estimate based on individual needs and circumstances.

Manual FUE Method
Essentially, it can be said that manual FUE hair transplant protect the donor area and provide good quality grafts.

At Asmed, we implement our original technique, the sequential (DES) technique while performing FUE hair transplants.

The goal of an FUE hair transplant is to achieve homogenization throughout the head. To provide homogenization, it is important to use all parts of the donor area in random distribution. Even after multiple sessions, the donor area appears to be slightly less dense than it was previously, but only upon close inspection.

The skull normally comes in different contours and shapes, creating a constant change in the direction and angle of the hair. With magnification and tactile sensation, one can visually and mentally process the subtle nuances of the skin and hair characteristics, and then extract the follicular unit with precision. According to the extracted follicle parameters, any situation can be adjusted in adequate time. This important step is omitted without immediate feedback potential.

With the Manual FUE technique, the donor area is maximized efficiently and conservatively, enabling the potential for future hair transplant procedures for the patient.

With the Manual FUE method, the patient's donor area is utilized as needed.

Megasessions
FUE hair transplant megasessions refers to transplanting a large number of grafts in a single session. At Asmed, we implement megasessions with great success.

The advantages of a megasession are; a faster end result and the convenience of having an FUE hair transplant in a single session rather than over several sessions.

The success of the FUE hair transplant requires mastery using micro-sized openings and special implanting techniques with high-powered magnification. Patients must be carefully selected . An experienced, well-organized FUE hair transplant surgical team and quality control is mandatory.

Lateral slit (coronal, perpendicular)
The incisions give the hair growth direction, angle, spacing, and depth so that the FUE hair transplant surgeon can sculpture and create a natural-looking.

Slit orientation for FUE hair transplants can be parallel or lateral. Incisions made perpendicular to the direction of hair growth are called lateral slits. Those made in a parallel direction are referred to as parallel (sagittal) slits.

The lateral technique reproduces better scalp anatomy. Natural hair varies from 10° to 90°. The lateral incision allows for precise control of graft angulation. Producing more acute angles also has the benefit of increasing coverage. By using smaller incisions we can produce greater densities.

Lateral orientation

causes less tissue damage
permits closer graft placement
makes hair strands shingle
creates the illusion of more volume
